  thesis: A typological analysis of mimetic words in Middle Chinese (6th-12th cent.) , 
  advisor: Jean-Christophe Verstraete , 
  mark: 17.4/20 , 
  summary: "Based on a corpus of Midde Chinese poetry, I identified a set of mimetic words in Middle Chinese. I worked on an analysis of their morphological, phonological, syntactical and semantical properties, against a typological background."}
  - {degree: MA Sinology ,
  thesis: "The Guwen yundong 古文运动 (Classical Prose Movement) during Tang and Song: Ideological as well as Stylistic Innovation?" ,
  advisor: Willy Vande Walle , 
  mark: 18.6/20 , 
  summary: "Using quantitative analyses (dendrograms, PCA, cluster analysis), I verified which authors were stylistically part of the Classical Prose Movement. This movement promoted an older style (used some four centuries or more earlier), condemning the formal style of the contemporary popular parallel prose. Unlike theoretical research hitherto suggested, my analysis shows that only a few authors formed the core of the movement. The presence of these authors fits nicely into the dominant framework of the emergence of Neo-Confucianism in the Song dynasty (10th-13th cent.)."}
